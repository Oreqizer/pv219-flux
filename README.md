# PV219 Flux demo

Welcome!

There are two versions:

* **Flux:** uncomment `flux.js` in `app/index.js` and comment `app.js`
* **Regular:** uncomment `app.js` in `app/index.js` and comment `flux.js`

### To run:

Install **node** on your system.

Run `npm i`. If you don't have **webpack** installed, install it with `npm i -g webpack`.

* **Mac/Linux:** `npm start`
* **Windows:** `webpack`, then `node server.js`

Then visit `http://localhost:1337`

Cheers!
